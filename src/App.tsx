/**
 * DIRECTION CONTRACT — tabrunner.app, "The Comet Field" (see DESIGN.md)
 *
 * THESIS: Tabs are comets — the browser's tab strip is a night sky, and every
 * task launches a tab that streaks across it with an emerald burn trail.
 * Refuses the category default (glowing orb hero + uniform bento of icon cards).
 * OWN-WORLD: deep-field indigo ground (#070b16 family); only two lights —
 * burn emerald (#10b981 family) for motion, telemetry amber (#fbbf24) for
 * measurement; Unbounded display / Figtree body / JetBrains Mono telemetry;
 * the comet-tab glyph recurs from favicon to canvas to screenshot frame.
 * STORY: a visitor sees a task enter the mission line, a comet leave it, and
 * a (labelled, simulated) run tick beside them — they understand in seconds
 * that an AI drives *their* browser, visibly, under their control — and they
 * install it from the store.
 * FIRST VIEWPORT: the page's own browser-chrome bar (comet favicon, omnibox,
 * glowing Download action); headline left with mission line and CTAs; live
 * run console right; comet field canvas behind everything.
 * FORM: grounded candidate 4 — browser chrome as compositional material —
 * assigned by seed f5e6e750 and fused with the user-pinned dark-cosmic
 * energy and the comet-burn palette (the retired royal purple's
 * replacement — the extension wears the same one).
