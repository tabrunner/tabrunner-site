  /**
   * Live since 2026-08-15, and the primary CTA everywhere.
   *
   * Deliberately the listing, not the CRX behind it. Chrome's update service
   * (`clients2.google.com/service/update2/crx`) does serve the store-signed
   * build from a stable URL, and dragging that file in works — it carries the
   * publisher proof a self-built CRX can never have. We skip it because it's an
   * undocumented internal channel, it serves the store's last-approved build
   * rather than `releases/latest`, and it trades one click for a download plus
   * a drag with none of the listing's trust signals. README's "The store CRX
   * endpoint" section has the working recipe and the cases that would justify
   * adding it *beside* this link (CWS-blocked regions, offline installs).
