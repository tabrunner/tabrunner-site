# tabrunner.app

Marketing and download site for [TabRunner](https://github.com/tabrunner/tabrunner) — a Chromium
extension that lets an LLM drive your real browser. Static site, deployed on its own cadence,
independent of the extension repo.

One page, five sections: hero with a live simulated run → feature constellation → product
screenshots → install flight plan → the privacy data map. English, Português (Brasil) and
Español.

## Stack

Vite · React 19 · Tailwind CSS 4 · i18next · bun. No router, no backend, no analytics.

```bash
bun install
bun run dev      # http://localhost:5173
bun run build    # typecheck → client build → SSR build → prerender → dist/
bun run preview  # serve the built dist/
bun run check    # self-checks: the run console's clock, and the address/head rules
```

## Design and product context

Three documents own the decisions; read them before changing the surface:

- **`PRODUCT.md`** — who this is for, what may and may not be claimed, distribution reality.
- **`DESIGN.md`** — "The Comet Field": the palette, type ramp, named rules, component specs.
- **`.impeccable/surfaces/src-app-tsx.md`** — the surface brief for the landing page.

The direction contract also lives at the top of `src/App.tsx`. The short version:

- Two lights only — burn emerald for motion, telemetry amber for measurement. No third hue, and
  never the retired purple (nor the brief cyan).
- Glow means live. Static content sits flat; only running things and the primary action glow.
- Monospace is only ever data — time, tokens, commands, refs. Prose never wears mono.
- One authored moment (the mission line launching a comet). Sections do not animate in;
  content is visible at rest.
- Icons are authored SVG at one stroke weight — no emoji, no unicode glyphs.
- No invented proof: no testimonials, logos, download counts, or star counts.

## The download contract

`src/lib/links.ts` is the only place install URLs live. GitHub URLs are **`releases/latest`
aliases only** — never a hardcoded version number, anywhere.

| What | URL |
| --- | --- |
| Store listing (primary CTA) | `chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tabrunner/<extension id>` |
| Zip, loaded unpacked (secondary) | `releases/latest/download/tabrunner-latest-chrome.zip` |
| Release notes | `releases/latest` |

**We never build a CRX ourselves.** None has shipped since v0.2.3, and none should: a CRX3
installs only if its header carries a `sha256_with_ecdsa` *publisher proof*, signed by a key
only Google holds at publish time. Pinning the manifest `key` reproduces the extension **ID**,
not that proof — so a self-built CRX fails with `CRX_REQUIRED_PROOF_MISSING` however it is
signed. That was the bug behind the 2026-08 zip flip.

Because the extension pins its manifest key to the store item's, the zip and the store install
**share one extension ID** — Chrome refuses to run both, so the install caveats tell anyone on
the unpacked build to remove it before installing from the store.

### The store CRX endpoint — deliberately not linked

The store's own CRX *does* carry the proof, and Chrome's update service will hand it over. This
works today (verified 2026-08-15 against our own item):

```bash
# Required: prodversion, acceptformat, and id. Everything else is optional —
# `prod` can be dropped, and installsource/uc are statistics only.
# Omitting prodversion or acceptformat returns 204 No Content, not an error.
curl -L "https://clients2.google.com/service/update2/crx\
?response=redirect&prod=chromium&prodversion=143.0.7499.41&acceptformat=crx3\
&x=id%3D<extension id>%26installsource%3Dondemand%26uc"
# → 302 to clients2.googleusercontent.com/crx/blobs/<opaque>/<ID>_0_2_1_0.crx
```

The `clients2` URL is stable; only its redirect target moves per release, and a browser follows
that transparently. A stale `prodversion` doesn't rot either — `90.0` still serves. So the
honest reason we don't link it is **not** that it breaks:

- It's an undocumented internal update channel with no support commitment for redistribution.
  It can change or start gating without notice, and nothing tells us when.
- It serves the **store's** last-approved build, which lags `releases/latest` (0.2.1 vs v0.2.8
  on the day of the flip) — so it would be a "Download" that is neither newest nor the zip.
- It costs the visitor a download, a `chrome://extensions` trip and a drag, where the listing
  costs one click.
- It drops every trust signal — verified publisher, reviews, the permissions disclosure. For an
  extension that asks for debugger-level access, those are the last things to throw away.

**When it would earn its place**, as a clearly-labelled secondary link and never the primary CTA:
visitors in regions where the Chrome Web Store is blocked (the real reason some well-known
extension pages offer a direct CRX), offline or air-gapped installs, and pinning a specific build
for testing. If that day comes, add it beside the zip in `LINKS`, not in place of `store`.

Edge publishes an equivalent (`edge.microsoft.com/extensionwebstorebase/v1/crx?response=redirect
&x=id%3D<id>%26installsource%3Dondemand%26uc`, no `prodversion` needed) — untested here, since
TabRunner has no Edge listing.

## Assets

```bash
bun run sync           # screenshots from ../chrome → public/screenshots (webp, 2 sizes)
bun run og             # regenerate public/og.png (1200×630 social card)
bun run shoot [url]    # screenshot the running site, report horizontal overflow
```

- **Screenshots** are captured in the extension repo (`chrome/docs/screenshots/`) and derived
  here into a 1280w and a 480w webp. Derivatives are committed, so a deploy needs neither this
  script nor the sibling repo. Requires `cwebp` (`brew install webp`).
- **The social card** is authored here by `scripts/gen-og.ts` from the comet-tab geometry and
  the vendored OFL fonts in `assets/fonts/`. It is no longer synced from the extension.
- **The comet-tab mark** has one geometry, in `src/components/CometMark.tsx`, mirrored in
  `public/favicon.svg` and `scripts/gen-og.ts`. Change it in all three or in none.
- `scripts/shoot.ts` scrolls the whole page before capturing — a `fullPage` screenshot never
  scrolls on its own, so anything gated on scroll position would otherwise photograph blank.

> **Known gap:** the product screenshots are from the pre-rename build — the panel is branded
> "Regent"/"Regentry", in the retired purple, with the old crown mark. The site labels them as
> old-brand (`shots.note`), but they need retaking against the current build before the site is
> promoted. See `PRODUCT.md` → Evidence on Hand.

## i18n

`src/i18n/locales/en-US.ts` is the reference locale and its shape is the `Locale` type — the
other two files fail to typecheck if they drift.

**The URL decides the language.** `/` is English, `/pt` is Portuguese, `/es` is Spanish, and
each is a real prerendered file announcing its own `<html lang>`, title, description, canonical and
hreflang set. It used to be one address whose language depended on who asked — which a crawler
cannot represent (it fetches an address once, and whatever it got is all that address will ever
mean, so two of the three languages were unreachable) and a reader cannot share (the link you send
shows the other person a different page than the one you were reading).

Detection is not gone, it is demoted: on an *unprefixed* address only, `?lang=` → a remembered
choice → the browser language can redirect once, before the first render. A reader who followed a
link to `/pt` is never moved off it, and a crawler never takes the hop at all. The legal docs
are synced from the extension repo in English only, so `/privacy` and `/terms` publish at one
address each instead of three that would claim a language they do not render.

Adding a page means adding it to `src/config/publicPages.ts` — that registry is what gets rendered
to files and what the sitemap lists, so a page can't exist in one and not the other.

## Deploy

Push to `main` → GitHub Actions checks, builds, deploys `dist/` to Cloudflare Pages and then
verifies the deployment it just made — against its own immutable URL, never the alias, which keeps
serving the previous build at 200 while the new one activates (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`).
Needs `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` and `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`
repository secrets, and a Pages project whose name matches `--project-name` in the workflow.
`tabrunner.app` attaches as the custom domain.
